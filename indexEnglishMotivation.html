        Good afternoon!
        My name is Vladimir, I'm a beginner front-end developer. It may seem that at my age this is not the most
        an optimistic start, but I am sure that I am able not only to adequately perform the assigned tasks, but I will
        also be able to
        transcend yourself and your past achievements in a new direction.
        Throughout my career, I devoted a lot of time to self-education.
        Each of my new places of work was not a repetition of the previous one, at each I independently understood new
        ones for
        yourself directions. At the same time, information technology has always attracted, and I have always taken on
        the tasks of this
        directions, although they were not part of my immediate job duties. So I'm at my first job
        developed a site layout and a product catalog of the enterprise to promote products. On your own initiative
        was trained and wrote programs for FESTO industrial controllers. On the other, I organized digital accounting
        materials and finished products, which before my arrival was carried out exclusively on paper, and was also
        engaged in
        site promotion. At the latter, I implemented a program for ordering components for assembly production, taking
        into account
        set parameters in EXCEL, which they still use there, and devoted a lot of time to studying issues
        management of personnel and production processes.
        Why frontend? I have a technical background. I like to solve non-standard problems. In frontend me
        attracts the opportunity to work together with all participants in the development process (designers, other
        developers, project
        manager, customers).

        Feri. Production of plastic products. Supervised by 18 employees. Familiarize yourself with the technology
        plastic processing. Under my leadership, 6 new lines were launched, which made it possible to increase the
        volume
        production by 20 times (seriously) and consistently increase the profit of the enterprise by 3-5% per year with
        an increase
        staff from 9 to 18 people in 10 years.
        ССС Manufacture of sanitary products. Another change in the field of activity. This time under my guidance
        It was
        not only production, but also material warehouse and service. In the process of optimizing the production
        structure
        management reduced the production staff from 6 to 3 people and I was given
        a task
        maintaining the volume of output, which was successfully implemented.
        World pack. The drawing programs AutoCAD and KOMPAS were independently mastered.
